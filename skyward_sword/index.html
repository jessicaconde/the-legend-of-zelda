    <br><br>skyward sword received a perfect score from IGN (10/10), but a relatively average score from Gamespot (7.5/10). fans praised the combat system introduced in this title, and the usage of wii motion plus, but had many complaints about the free-roaming in the sky. it was also criticized for "being too linear".

            <p>skyward sword definitely has lots of value to me simply because it stands at the beginning of the timeline story-wise. it also has probably the most frustrating bosses ive ever fought out of all the other zelda games, but that just made it worth getting through even more. cute story, amazing soundtrack (though that's not unusual for a zelda game) and very soft art style. 9/10 from me.</p>
