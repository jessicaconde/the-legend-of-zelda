    <div class="container"> <div class="maintextbox">hello and welcome! this is just a small little site dedicated to my, jessica conde's, favorite video game series of all time: the legend of zelda. my first ever zelda game was twilight princess, and i played it way back when i was around 10 or 11 (i honestly can't remember). this game was my gateway into the internet after becoming a huge fan, and from there i expanded my horizons into many other games and hobbies. i owe a lot to this series as a whole--it feels like home.

    <br><br>here you'll find links (haha, get it? links?) to other pages on breath of the wild, skyward sword, and twilight princess. they give short little summaries of each game and a bit on the reception they got after their respective releases. i also give my personal opinion on them in separate popout windows. ;)
