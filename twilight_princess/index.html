    <br><br>twilight princess's release was highly anticipated by long-time zelda fans and general gamers alike, since it was the first in the series to take a more realistic and mature route (it was also the first zelda game to be given a T rating by ESRB). it was then praised for its world design and art direction after its release, but its wii release gained a much more controversial response, as many pointed out that the motion controls were problematic. it became the best-selling zelda game until it was overtaken by breath of the wild in 2018.
