    <br><br>twilight princess's release was highly anticipated by long-time zelda fans and general gamers alike, since it was the first in the series to take a more realistic and mature route (it was also the first zelda game to be given a T rating by ESRB). it was then praised for its world design and art direction after its release, but its wii release gained a much more controversial response, as many pointed out that the motion controls were problematic. it became the best-selling zelda game until it was overtaken by breath of the wild in 2018.

            <p>twilight princess was the first ever zelda game i played, and for that, it'll always have a special place in my heart. this was also probably the first story-driven game ive ever played entirely on my own, and at the age of 10 at that! i started to use the internet after becoming a fan, which lead me all the way to where i am now. more about the game itself, i really liked the introduction of a sidekick-type character--i obviously got stuck a lot since i was quite literally a small child during my first run-through, so having in-game guidance pretty much whenever i needed it really helped me enjoy the gameplay just as much as the story. overall: amazing. 15/10.</p>
